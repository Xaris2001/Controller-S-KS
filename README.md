# S-KS-H-
Design an S/KS 𝐻∞ PI – controller for the process:
𝐺(𝑠) = 4/(s-1)(0.02s+1)^2 
with the two performance weights that were given in the course
lectures. Plot the response of the closed loop system. Find
𝜔𝑐, 𝑀𝑆, 𝑀𝑇, 𝐺Μ, 𝑃Μ. (Hint use the minimax solver of MATLAB)
Repeat the task by employing the mixsyn solver of MATLAB. What is
the controller. Compare it with the 𝐻∞ PI – controller.
